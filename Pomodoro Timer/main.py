        #using the after() method, after 1000 ms, it will perform a function (count_down() in this case, which is why its recursive)), and pass 
        #the following parameters into said function (in this case, count - 1)
    else:
        start_timer()   #This is so the timer keeps going automatically once it reaches 0
